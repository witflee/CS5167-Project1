<!-- I planned on this to show a table with the user's 
 times organized by vehicle, track, and tire type, 
 but I didn't give myself enough time to implement it.
 Original plan: table of lap times per track where each cell 
 is colored red or green based on whether it's slower 
 or faster than the previous time. -->
